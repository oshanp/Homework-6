# Homework-6
The objective of this homework is to give you experience using software modeling with UML. This
exercise will help familiarize you with several different UML diagrams and with software conceptual
design. These are requirements and conceptual design related activities, so you should not have to
implement any code for this assignment.
The scenario: You have been telling your boss about a “fantastic” software engineering course you are
taking; you tell her that you are quickly on the path to becoming a “Ninja Programmer “and are
developing an expertise in UML. Naturally, she is very impressed so she appoints you to lead a team
which will develop an accounting system that will be used to control project funding. Initially, your
software will provide the capability for a manager to set up and allocate funds for each project. The
project employees will enter a timecard weekly showing the number of hours worked on each project.
An accounting person will enter the hours worked by individuals on each project – the individuals may be
either salaried, or hourly - and as part of the process, will adjust the amount of funding left to be spent.
If the project funds are depleted, the manager will be notified and work on the project will cease. The
payroll clerk will pay the hourly employees weekly and the salaried employees monthly.
For now, you will not have to implement any work stoppage mechanisms needed when the project funds
run out, nor worry about dealing with the deficits that may occur when the funds are running low.
For this design effort, you will do the following:
1. Develop a UML use case diagram which describes the requirements given above.
2. Develop activity diagrams for:
 The project set up and funds allocation activity
 The timecard entry activity
 The project accounting activity
 The payroll activity
Wherever possible, try and define common functions that can be included in multiple activities. For
example, you may want to have an adjust project funding activity that has multiple uses. The manager
may adjust the funding upward, while the account person will adjust the funding downward.
